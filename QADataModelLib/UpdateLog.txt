20200710 - Development of the 20200710 branch
TASK 01 Create list of questions from the TreeView form allowing the selection of a subject node
	as well as the currently allowed qaNode.
	1. I am going to delete the question type menu item and set question type to seriatem 
	waiting for some future version to add the ability to randomize the questions. DONE
	2. Rather than revising any of the old procedures at this time I am going to create additional
	procedures that do not yet call on the AnswerQuestions form
		a. To get all of the qaFiles in the children of a selected subject node, including that
		of its children divisions, I will  create a TreeNodeCollection and iterate thru it see
		(see TreeView	Iterate thru nodes in the How To docx.) selecting all qaFile nodes whose
		nodeName begins with the desired subject node name
		b. I have changed to qaDictionary from an <int,string> to a <string,string> and the answer
		question mechanism appears to work
		c.I HAVE NOT TESTED CREATING OR EDITIND A NEW QAFILE
		d. I will COMMIT these changes and in the next version I will change the qaDictionary to:
			Key = int created from the current number of dictionary entries
			Value = ^ delimited string 
				1. Question number string = qaFileIDNumber+"-"+"question number"
				2. Question string
				3. Answer string
				4. Image URL
				5. mp3 URL
				6. +/- a question priority intStr where:
					1) blank or "0" means  answer only in a qaFile quiz/test
					2) "1" = answer in a test/quiz of a qaFile Parent node
					3) "3" = answer when the selected node is greater than a qaFile Parent node

TASK 02 Create the list of questions and answers from the TreeView form, not when the AnswerQuestions
	form is called. THIS TASK IS DEFERED TO THE NEXT VERSION SO THAT I CAN INCORPERATE USING
	A SUBJECT NODE (FOR EXAMPLE THE GREEK NODE UNDER CHRISTIANITY HISTORY FORMATIVE ENVIORNMENT)
	THIS WILL CREATE A QUIZ OR EXAMINATION ON ALL OF THE SUB qaFILES OF THE GREEK SUBJECT NODE

TASK 01 Check to see if you can take a quiz and then take a test without closing and re-opening
	No. When I tried to take a test without clearing it still dealt with the questions as
	if they were a quiz, ie they repeated those incorrectly answered
 After taking a quiz, what variables must be cleared?
TASK 01 DOONEI HAVE succesfully modified the code so that one can take a quiz, an exam without leaving 
	the AnswerQuestions form


20200401
1.	Added code to the QuestionAndAnswerForm to deal with an empty QAFile
2.	Added code to update the question and answer pair number when appending questions
3.	Make sure that tilda '~' are replaced by \n\r when questions or answers are sent to the 
	QuestionAndAnswerForm -DONE
4.	In the QuestionAndAnswerForm make sure that the SaveFileAndreturn menu option applies
	when the test type is a Quiz - DONE
5.	Changed creating a new qaFile from using File.Create to useing filestream = File.Create
	so the file stream can be closed avoind a 'File In Use By Another Process' Error
6.	Cleared an error that if the HyperlinkDictionary had already been defined it would
	throw an error if an new hyperlink was called
